    <p>Hey everyone! My name is Drew Breneman. I live in Ammon, Idaho with my amazing little family that includes myself, my wife Amelia, and our two dogs, Izzy and Luna. Izzy is our 90 lb female chocolate lab mix and Luna is a 13 lb female poodle mix. They definitely keep us on our toes, and we love having them around. I was born and raised in Medicine Hat, Alberta in Canada. I was blessed to be able to serve a mission in the Salt Lake/Layton Utah Mission from 2018-2020 and I absolutely loved it! I met my beautiful wife during my very first semester here at BYUI, only a month after my mission, and we were happily married 7 months later. My wife and I are both working and I am going to school- I am cruising along through it which is exciting!</p>
    <p>I still have quite a few semesters left to complete my Software Engineering degree so we will be sticking around in Idaho for a while. Something unique about me is that I have a few side businesses to keep me busy in my free time, including an RV rental business I manage with my wife, and a PC building business that I do with a friend. When I am not doing homework, working, or at the dog park, I am playing video games, spending time with my wife and puppies, listening to music, or doing anything that has to do with technology. I think the world has become so much more reliant on technology so I am trying to learn new things like web design to help me in my future career.</p>
